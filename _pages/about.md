## About

I am an assistant professor of Economics in the [School of Social Sciences](http://www.sss.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx) at [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg) (NTU), Singapore. My research focuses on behavioral and experimental economics with direct implications for public policy. I study how individuals make decisions -- purchasing and selling, paying taxes, donating, responding to nudges -- and how behavioral factors such as loss aversion, projection bias, salience, and social preferences shape those choices. Recently I have been digging into belief formation and the role of behavioral factors in how people update their expectations.

Please find my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5iat2bc67irowknfu4tlk/juboyan_cv_2024mkt.pdf?rlkey=tg577wsi7zuzgrue3lxnld9jt&dl=0) or email me for more information. I appreciate your interest, but I am **not taking additional PhD students at NTU**. If you are interested in pursuing a PhD at NTU, please contact colleagues who work on behavioral and experimental topics. Also note that NTU's email server may block messages that include hyperlinks -- if you do include links, please reach me at **jy489@cornell.edu** instead.
